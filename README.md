# feedback

A small example of particle systems in Clojure.

## Usage

This works best from Light Table. Load the code in core,
and then repeatedly execute `do-frame`. To see different behaviour,
change the code in update-particles and load in that function.

From the command line:

    lein run -m particlj.core
